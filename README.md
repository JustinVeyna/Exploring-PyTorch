# Exploring-PyTorch
Exploring and leaning how to use PyTorch starting from installation and set-up.

## Installation
* ~~Download CUDA for to allow PyTorch to utilize your *nvidea* graphics card.~~ Turns out the next step installs CUDA for you.
  * ~~https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads~~

* Download PyTorch for *Windows 10* using anaconda (PyTorch is not originally made to be compatible with windows).

    * `conda install -c peterjc123 pytorch cuda90`

## Learning
I found a promising github repository so I will use it to learn the basics.
